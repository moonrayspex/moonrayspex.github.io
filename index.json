Image initially overlayed on standard false colour composite of an orthophotographic image of the same area from 2013 (not shown).\nFigure 1. Below: Bailieboro LiDAR (sensor and date of acquisition) DSM (Digital Surface Model) shown in shaded relief.\nDSM derived from elevation point cloud layer. Forest, hedge rows and powerlines are prominent. Figure 2. Below: Bailieboro LiDAR DTM (Digital Terrain Model) shown in shaded relief.\nDTM derived from elevation point cloud layer.\nDTM depicts terrain undulations with the absence of surface vegetation and human structures. Figure 3. Below: Bailieboro LiDAR CHM (Canopy Height Model) using Jenks classification.\nCHM is the result of subtracting the DTM from the DSM.\nAreas of colour depict vegetation heights; areas absence of colour have little to no vegetative height. Areas with highest CHM are red and a decrease in height corresponds with colour shift to orange, yellow, light green, respectively. Note, power lines are present in this model due to their height.\n","permalink":"https://moonrayspex.github.io/projects/creations/lidar_chm/","tags":["remote sensing","LiDAR","DSM","DTM","PCI Geomatica / Catalyst"],"title":"Modelling Canopy Height Model with LiDAR and Photogrammetric-derived Point Clouds"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Map created using Ontario datasets in ArcGIS Pro and Mapublisher for AI.\n","permalink":"https://moonrayspex.github.io/projects/creations/cwpp_map/","tags":["cartography","ArcGIS Pro","Mapublisher for Adobe Illustrator","canoe route map"],"title":"Chiniguchi Waterways Provincial Park Canoe Route Map"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Scope of project is lakes in Peterborough and the Kawarthas.
