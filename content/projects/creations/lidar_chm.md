Imagery derived from elevation classified photogrammetric-derived elevation point cloud layer.  
Source image from Ontario GeoHub of a 1 km 2 area near Bailieboro, Ontario. 
Image initially overlayed on standard false colour composite of an orthophotographic image of the same area from 2013 (not shown).

Figure 1. Bailieboro LiDAR (sensor and date of acquisition) DSM (Digital Surface Model) shown in shaded relief.  
DSM derived from elevation point cloud layer. 
Forest, hedge rows and powerlines are prominent.

Figure 2. Left: Bailieboro LiDAR DTM (Digital Terrain Model) shown in shaded relief.  
DTM derived from elevation point cloud layer.   
DTM depicts terrain undulations with the absence of surface vegetation and human structures.

Figure 3. Left: Bailieboro LiDAR CHM (Canopy Height Model) using Jenks classification.  
CHM is the result of subtracting the DTM from the DSM.  
Areas of colour depict vegetation heights; areas absence of colour have little to no vegetative height. 
Areas with highest CHM are red and a decrease in height corresponds with colour shift to orange, yellow, light green, respectively. 
 Note, power lines are present in this model due to their height.
